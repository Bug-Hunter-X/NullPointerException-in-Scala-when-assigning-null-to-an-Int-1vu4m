This repository contains a demonstration of a common Scala error: attempting to assign null to a primitive type (Int in this case).  The bug.scala file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.scala provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from the fact that primitive types in Scala (like Int, Double, etc.) cannot be null; they are always initialized with a default value. Attempting to override it with null will lead to a NullPointerException. This is a frequent error that often goes unnoticed during development.
